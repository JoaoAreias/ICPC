# Training plan

This is a compilation of a list of problems and implementation of the solutions aimed to training for the ICPC competiton, targeting some of the most important algorithms and data structures in it. This list was compiled based on the information on the following articles a [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/):

- [How to prepare for ACM â€“ ICPC?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-prepare-for-acm-icpc/)
